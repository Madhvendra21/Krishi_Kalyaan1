🌾 Krishi Kalyaan – A Data-Centric Approach to Agricultural Lending
Krishi Kalyaan is a precision-focused web platform developed to assist financial institutions in making informed decisions while evaluating loan applications from farmers. The system leverages structured agricultural datasets and machine learning models to analyze a farmer’s likelihood of loan repayment, reducing risk for lenders and improving access to credit for farmers.

🔍 Problem Context
Farmers often struggle with loan approvals due to a lack of reliable data and standardized evaluation methods. Banks, on the other hand, face difficulty in assessing repayment risk in agriculture-dominated regions. Krishi Kalyaan addresses this gap by introducing an analytical layer between farmers and financial institutions.
